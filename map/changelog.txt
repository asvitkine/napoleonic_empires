Corvettes are no longer supportable (they never were).
For future reference, in case it should come up, Corvettes are like submarines. If there is no enemy destroyer-type unit (frigate) in the battle, Corvettes can and should be able to: offensive and defensive first strike, offensive and defensive separate retreat (to another sea zone, is not a submerge), and Corvettes may not pass through other Corvettes.
